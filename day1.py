#You can add 2 digits or variable values in Python using the following code:

# define the variables
num1 = 5
num2 = 10

# add the variables
sum = num1 + num2

# print the result
print("The sum of the two numbers is:", sum)


print('''
        In this code, we define two variables `num1` and `num2` and 
      assign them the values 5 and 10, respectively. 
      We then add the values of these variables and 
      store the result in a new variable called `sum`. 
      Finally, we print the result.
