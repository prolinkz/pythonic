    * This tutorial is an introduction to time series forecasting using TensorFlow. It builds a few different styles of models including Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks (CNNs and RNNs).

This is covered in two main parts, with subsections:

- Forecast for a single time step:
    A single feature.
    All features.
- Forecast multiple steps:
    Single-shot: Make the predictions all at once.
    Autoregressive: Make one prediction at a time and feed the output back to the model.
