* MiniConda: Conda Environment gave an environment to run set of different tools/applications.
Suppose we use 3 different environment; 
-1st for machine_learning and the tools used for Python=v3.9, Pandas=2.0, Numpy=1.21.1, Sklearn
-2nd environment for Deep_Learrning and the Tools installed or required Python=v3.7, Pandas=2.9, Numpy=1.23, TensorFlow
-3rd environment for AI_apps where tools are required as Python=3.11.2, Pandas=2.3, Numpy=1.21.3, Streamlit

So each environment has different version of Python running on a single machine, which is the benefit of MiniConda to provide different rooms/environments
